# ☁️ Cloud Engineering Portfolio 🚀  

Welcome to my **Cloud Engineering Portfolio**. Rather than just telling you about my cloud engineering expertise and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) work, I'd rather **show you**.  

This repository is a living, open-source collection of cloud infrastructure projects designed to **demonstrate** my technical skills, problem-solving approach, and best practices in modern cloud engineering.  

## 🌍 **Why Open Source?**  
Cloud engineering is best understood in action, and I believe in **learning in public**. By sharing my work openly, I aim to:  
✅ **Showcase my expertise** in infrastructure automation, cloud architectures, and DevOps best practices.  
✅ **Provide reusable IaC templates** for the community to accelerate cloud adoption.  
✅ **Encourage collaboration** so others can contribute, learn, and improve on these solutions.  

## 🔧 **Technologies & Tools Used**  
This portfolio includes hands-on projects using:  
- ☁️ **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure  
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation  
- 🌀 **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/AKS)  
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline  
- 🔒 **Security & Compliance:** IAM, AWS Security Hub, WAF, Secrets Management  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability:** DataDog, Prometheus, CloudWatch  

## 🛠️ **Projects in This Portfolio**
